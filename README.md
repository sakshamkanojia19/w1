React Spring Rich Text Editor & Counter App

Overview

This application is built using React Spring for animations and integrates a Rich Text Editor that saves data into Local Storage. The data is stored in a stack-like manner, similar to a To-Do List, under a profile section. Additionally, the home page includes:

A persistent counter that retains its value across renders.

A form for saving user details, making a POST request to the backend.

A color-changing div that updates dynamically as the counter increases.

TailwindCSS for styling.

This project showcases frontend and backend integration, emphasizing state management, animations, and local data persistence.
